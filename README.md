# My Useful Scripts

Tiny little scripts I find useful for things I don't always remember how to do.

*Project status:* This project isn't my current focus, but I will look at
issues and pull requests.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmanuel1/useful-scripts
```

All scripts are in the `src` folder. They're separated into sub-folders by
operating system/platform. You should be able to run each script in its
respective OS without any extra dependencies. If that's not the case, extra
instructions will appear at the top of the script.

### Prerequisites

Windows scripts in `src/windows` will run on Windows. Linux scripts may be
added later.

### Running a script

There's no installation process. Just run a script from your terminal!

```
rem Windows example
src\windows\battery-report
rem A battery-report.html file appears in your current working directory.
```

## Support

To report issues, report them on
[Github](https://github.com/jmanuel1/useful-scrips/issues). Questions should
also be directed to the issue page.

## Roadmap

* Add my other helpful scripts as a version 0.0.1
* Develop tests for scripts
* Add documentation for each script
* Remove unnecessary dependencies from scripts

## Contributing

If you edit or add a script, please help out and add tests and documentation.
New scripts should come with a justification of their usefulness. Remember to
keep scripts separated by OS, with as few dependencies as reasonably possible.
